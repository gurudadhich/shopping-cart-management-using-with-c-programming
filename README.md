in this repository we will see a Shopping cart management system using with c programming. here i used some basic concepts of c to create this project.
i create a hardcoded inventory of products detail. we can use that and perform some functions on the  simple cart project. we can choose and add product in
the cart. And also we can show the choosen products in the cart. after add products we can do checkout.
when we run this project on our system it asks that please select your option and we can see some options there. we select one option and go to forward. after choosing purchage product we will see a product inventory(details). we can choose product by its given id number and it will look in show cart function by its proper detail. After choosing products we have option that either we can continue choose products or directly jump to the option menu where we will see show cart, purchage product, checkout and exit options. we can see our choosen products in show cart option and can do checkout also from cart.
